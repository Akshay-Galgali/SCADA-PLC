Automation of two chemical mixing in a tank with application of OT security.
[This project is developed and demostrated in SCADA-BR]

In this project, I have to mix two chemicals automatically in a tank where there should be two valve controlling the flow of two chemicals. After two chemicals are brought into the mixing tank the stirring motor should be turned on automatically for few minutes and open the output valve.

We need to control the two valves in a tank automatically and stirring motor and the output v

We need to control the two valves in a tank automatically and stirring motor and the output valve using PLC programming with ladder logic. The whole process should be automated and no human interaction should be in need to control the process. The control system should also have emergency, and control measures by which the system can be managed by humans manually.

OT security applications:
-> Industrial Control System Firewall.
-> Restrcited/Limited Remote Control.
-> Following Standards NIST SP 800-42 and NIST SP 800-82.
